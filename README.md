# FIFER
A Fast Image Feature Extraction and Registration (FIFER) method for motion correction of two-photon Ca2+ imaging data. FIFER is a GUI software which can adapt parameter for each data.

## This edition is a dynamic library warpped by python function, which has **no parameter** (but need to select a ROI in the GUI surface).

## Usage of this library
### 1. install two python lib
#### 1.1 opencv-python
#### 1.2 numpy
### 2. import func.py
### 3. done (func.motioncorrection)

# Notice: Further research is coming soon with a complete GUI toolbox (including various algorithms), which is about registration for calcuim imaging data of different days (cross-session) 

# For other details: see master branch or read my manuscript.
# If you like this tool, please cite the manuscript below.
